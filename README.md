pev2, with a backend

## Development

There's a `shell.nix`, enter a `nix-shell` or put `use nix` in an `.envrc` file to develop.

## Deployment

See the `heroku.yml` github action; you can set a repository secret on your own fork to deploy to your own Heroku instance. You'll need Postgres provisioned.
