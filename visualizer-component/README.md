# visualizer-component

Based on the example [codesandbox for PEV2](https://codesandbox.io/s/pev2-ry2dd)

From [the README](https://github.com/dalibo/pev2/tree/f2bc8341b84e33186c5fbfab0633f80054f6c7d3#integrated-in-a-web-application)

Note that PEV2 as a component, at the time of writing, does _not_ work with Vue 3, so don't even try it -- unless you're also upgrading PEV2!
